Designed the back end for a fitness tracker site by creating a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## User Story
AS A user

I WANT to be able to view create and track daily workouts.

I WANT to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.

SO THAT track the name, type, weight, sets, reps and duration of exercise, and if the exercise is a cardio exercise, should be able to track my distance traveled.
